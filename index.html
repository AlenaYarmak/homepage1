        <p class="intro__text">I have a keen interest in web development and enjoy building
          responsive and user-friendly websites. In my free time, I also
          enjoy exploring the world of cinema and photography. I have
          recently developed an interest in drones and enjoy using them
          to capture stunning aerial footage. Overall, my passion for
          creativity and innovation fuels my desire to constantly learn
          and grow in these areas.</p>
